## > printf("Hello world! ðŸ‘‹");

I'm Stepan and after 15 years of working in media, I decided to go for IT! I'm into data and programming, but never say no to learning something new - and I a do, everyday, as learning is really an infinite loop. Moving on a wheelchair, I have intensive experience of how technology can make your life better. You can folow my adventure here ðŸ’ª.

#### What am I working on now? 
I made it throught the Piscine at the end of 2022 and as of January 2023, I became a student of 42 Prague.
