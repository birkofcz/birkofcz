### > printf("Hello world! 👋");

I'm Stepan and after 15 years of working in media, I steered the ship into IT waters. I'm into data and programming, but I never say no to learning something new - and I a do, everyday, as learning is really an infinite loop. Moving on a wheelchair, I have a first-hand experience of how technology can make your life better. I decided I want to be a part of this 💪.
