## > printf("Hello world! ðŸ‘‹");

I'm Stepan and after 15 years of working in media, I decided to go for IT! I'm into **data** and **coding**, but never say no to learning something new - and I a do, everyday, as learning is really an infinite loop. Moving on a wheelchair, I have intensive experience of how technology can make your life better. You can folow my adventure here ðŸ’ª.

#### What am I working on now? 
I made it through the Piscine and as of January 2023, I became a student at **[42 Prague](https://42prague.com).**

You can see some of the projects here:
level 0: **libft** - my first library of functions
level 1: **ft_printf** - recoding the printf function
level 1: **get_next_line** - reading a line from the file descriptor
level 2: **minitalk** - small communication program using Unix signals
level 2: **push_swap** - sorting data on a stack
level 2: **fract'ol** - rendering fractals using the school's graphic library minilibx
