## > printf("Hello world! ðŸ‘‹");

I'm Stepan and after 15 years of working in media, I decided to go for IT! I'm into **data** and **coding**, but never say no to learning something new - and I a do, everyday, as learning is really an infinite loop. Moving on a wheelchair, I have intensive experience of how technology can make your life better. You can follow my adventure here ðŸ’ª.
