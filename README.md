I'm Stepan and after 15 years of working in media, I decided to go for IT!

I'm into data and programming, but I never say no to learning something new - and I a do, everyday, as learning is really an infinite loop. The possibilities of what we can handle and create with today's tools are really amazing - and I'm not even speaking of tommorow.

As a wheelchair guy, I have a first-hand experience of how technology can make your life better. 

I decided to be a part of this ðŸ’ª.
